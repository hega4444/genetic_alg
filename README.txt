Project: Creating my first genetic algorithm in Python

Goal: Program requests a string as an input from the user, it should be a string of characters in lowercase [a:z]. It will also accept the adjustment of certain parameters, for example mutation rate or max. number of generations to create. Then, it will show the best solutions in every generation and finally the solution given by the last generation next to the accuracy rate. 

Main components of the solution: 

    • Genetic representation of a solution.
    • A function to generate new solutions. 
    • Fitness function.
    • Selection function. 
    • Crossover function.
    • Mutation function.
